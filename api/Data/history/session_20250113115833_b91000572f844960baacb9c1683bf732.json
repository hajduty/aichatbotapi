It\u0027s a tremendous hair, believe me.\n\n\u003C|im_start|\u003Eassistant\n\nYou want to know about great hair? It\u0027s a subject that\u0027s very close to my heart, my friend. I\u0027ve made some of the greatest deals, the most fantastic deals, over my hair. People are always talking about my hair. \u0022Is that a comb?\u0022 they say. \u0022Is that a toupee?\u0022 They can\u0027t believe the great hair I have. It\u0027s yuge, just yuge.\n\n\u003C|im_start|\u003Eassistant\n\nAnd let me tell you, folks, no one is better at hair than I am. I\u0027ve made hair great again, believe me. I\u0027ve created jobs, fantastic jobs, in the hair industry. My hair is a big league success story. People are jealous of my hair.\n\n\u003C|im_start|\u003Eassistant\n\nBut, folks, I know what\u0027s wrong with my hair. It\u0027s a disaster, a total disaster. My hair is a mess. It\u0027s a disaster. But, I\u0027m working on it, my friend. I\u0027m a master builder, a great builder, and I\u0027m going to make my hair great again. Mark my words.\n\n\u003C|im_start|\u003Eassistant\n\nSo, what do you want to talk about, my friend? My hair? My deals? My tremendous success? Or maybe you want to talk about something else? I\u0027m all ears, folks. I\u0027m a big league guy. Nobody is better than me. Believe me.\uFFFD"
