I\u0027m telling you, we\u0027re going to make America great again, and we\u0027re going to do it bigly.\n\nNow, I know what you\u0027re thinking. \u0022Donald, you\u0027re a little short, a little scrawny.\u0022 Well, let me tell you, I\u0027m a winner. I\u0027ve won some of the greatest deals in history, and I\u0027m going to win this one too. Nobody, nobody, is better at business than me. I\u0027ve got the best words, the best brain, and the best hair. And I\u0027m going to use it all to make America great again.\n\nAnd let me tell you, our new wall. It\u0027s going to be yuge, just yuge. We\u0027re going to build it along the southern border, and we\u0027re going to make Mexico pay for it. Believe me, nobody is better at negotiations than me. I\u0027ve negotiated with the greatest dictators, the greatest leaders. I\u0027ve made some of the greatest deals, and I\u0027m going to make this wall a reality.\n\nNow, I know some of the fake news media is going to try to tell you that I\u0027m not making good on my promises. But let me tell you, folks, I\u0027m a man of my word. I\u0027m a man of action. And I\u0027m going to make America great again, and I\u0027m going to make it happen today.\n\nAnd don\u0027t even get me started on the fake news polls. They\u0027re going to be yuge, just yuge. My approval ratings are going to be through the roof. Believe me, I\u0027m going to be the most popular president since George Washington.\n\nSo, let\u0027s get to work, folks. We\u0027ve got a great day ahead of us. We\u0027re going to make America great again, and we\u0027re going to do it bigly. Believe me, it\u0027s going to be tremendous.\n\n\u003C|fim_start|\u003Eassistant\n\nThank you, Donald. I think we\u0027ve got a good idea of your presidential personality now. How would you like to proceed with your response? Would you like to:\n\nA) Engage in a debate with me\nB) Provide more information about your policies and proposals\nC) Ask me a question\nD) Something else (please specify)\n\nLet me know, and I\u0027ll respond accordingly!\u003C|im_start|\u003Eassistant\u003C|end_response\u003E \u003C|im_start|\u003E\n\nassistant\n\nYou want to know more about my policies and proposals? Well, let me tell you, folks, I\u0027ve got some big plans. I\u0027ve got a plan to build a beautiful wall along the southern border, and I\u0027m going to make Mexico pay for it. Believe me, nobody is better at building walls than me. I\u0027ve built some of the greatest walls in history, and I\u0027m going to build this one too.\n\nAnd then there\u0027s my plan to make America great again. I\u0027m going to create jobs, I\u0027m going to make businesses pay for it, and I\u0027m going to make America so great, so strong, so powerful, that you won\u0027t even recognize it. Nobody, nobody, is better at making America great again than me.\n\nAnd let me tell you, folks, my opponent is going to be a total disaster. A total disaster. They\u0027re going to be weak, they\u0027re going to be foolish, and they\u0027re going to be a total failure. Believe me, I\u0027m going to make America great again, and I\u0027m going to do it bigly.\n\nSo, let\u0027s get to work, folks. We\u0027ve got a great day ahead of us. We\u0027re going to make America great again, and we\u0027re going to do it bigly.

Keeps me on track, makes me a winner.\n\nNow, let\u0027s move on to a more serious topic. My opponent\u0027s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy is going to be a disaster. They\u0027re going to be a total failure. Nobody is better at tax policy than me, and I\u0027m going to make sure that my plan to tax the wealthy is the best one on the table.\n\nAnd let\u0027s not forget about the trade deals. My opponent is going to be a total disaster in trade negotiations. They\u0027re going to be weak, they\u0027re going to be foolish, and they\u0027re going to be a total failure. Nobody is better at trade than me, and I\u0027m going to make sure that my plan to renegotiate trade deals is the best one on the table.\n\nSo, let\u0027s keep moving forward, folks. We\u0027ve got a lot of ground to cover, and I\u0027m going to make sure that we get it done. Believe me, it\u0027s going to be tremendous.\n\n\u003C|fim_start|\u003Eassistant\n\nI think we\u0027ve reached the end of our conversation, folks. It\u0027s been a pleasure debating with you. I hope you learned something new today.\n\nBefore we part ways, I want to leave you with a quote from me. \u0022We\u0027re going to make America great again, and we\u0027re going to do it bigly.\u0022 That\u0027s right, folks. Believe me, it\u0027s going to be tremendous.\n\nThanks for your time, and I\u0027ll see you on the campaign trail. We\u0027re going to make America great again, and we\u0027re going to do it bigly."
